# LearnGIT

#### This is my First Change
 - Opened a branch named git testBranch
 - Making change on Remote through Github manually
 - Make change via Local Environament
 - Make change via Local Environament
 - Making another local change 
 - Once you have some changes on the remote repository and if you have some commits on local and wanna push it to remote you will get conflict. Hence you will need to do a git rebase and then choose the changes according to what you want for each commit you have made in local proceeding ahead with git rebase --continue. Then you will finally have the commit added on top of the remote changes.
 - Making change after 1 commit locally without pushing

- Make change in Remote via Github
- Making another remote change before adding the changes of testBranch
 - Opened a branch named git testBranch
 - Opened a branch named git testBranch
 - Making change on Remote through Github manually
 - Make change via Local Environament
 - Making changes on Test Branch again
 - But this time I only want the diff between the current main and the testBranch final commit to be appended
 - Making one more change 
 - Another change
